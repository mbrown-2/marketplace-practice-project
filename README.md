# marketplace-practice-project

## Goal:
- More practice with components, basic API calls, object interfaces, UI layouts, dynamic rendering, state hooks, and more.
- It's still just the start so far. The project begins based on tutorials provided by codewithmosh.com

## Personal roadmap:
1. Complete the course and solidify foundations and understanding.
2. Modify, rebuild, and enhance UI and layout. Introduce original functionality (i.e. more pages, popups, animations, and more API calls).
3. Leverage as part of personal portfolio --> original website to contain this plus other personal projects
